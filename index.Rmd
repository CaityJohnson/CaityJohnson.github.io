Welcome to my website! My name is Caitlyn, but most people call me Caity. I created this for my Data Science class at Appalachian State University. I hope that, based off of this site, you can learn some interesting facts about me. You can use [this link](https://github.com/CaityJohnson/CaityJohnson.github.io) to get to my GitHub page that I used to create this website.
